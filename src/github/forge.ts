// Forge PRs: the bot's draft PRs in jmarrero-forge that wait for
// jmarrero's review. Pure functions over REST JSON (search results,
// reviews, patches, checks) and the review the app submits, so tests
// feed them synthetic payloads.
//
// The review is what `bot-pr promote` keys on: the latest APPROVED,
// CHANGES_REQUESTED or DISMISSED review by jmarrero, or conversation
// comment of his with a `/promote` line, decides, and an approval counts
// only for the commit it names (commit_id), which must be the PR's
// current head. So the app always submits with commit_id set to the head
// it showed, after checking the head didn't move. A `/promote` comment
// names no commit; bot-pr dates it against the push log, which the app
// can't read, so it shows such a PR as promoted but leaves the decision
// (and the PR, in the queue) to bot-pr.
