// "Make it mine": he takes over the text of one of the bot's forge PRs,
// for upstreams whose contribution policy is human-text (the title, body
// and commit messages must be his). With his own token the app sets the
// title and body, rewrites every commit of the branch with his message
// and him as committer (same tree, parents and author), moves the branch
// there with a compare-and-swap on the head he was shown, and comments
// `/promote --human-text`.
//
// `bot-pr promote` then checks what GitHub recorded, not what the text
// says: his login pushed the approved head (the fork's activity log
// records a Git Data API ref update as a push by the token's user), made
// the body's last edit, and set the title last; and the body lost the
// bot's `Generated-by` line. See human_text_problems in homegit's
// bin/bot-pr.
//
// Writing with his token is an exception to the app's review-only role,
// so it is kept narrow: only the bot's PRs within a jmarrero-forge fork,
// from a `bot/` branch; trees are never changed (each new commit is
// checked against the old one); the ref moves only from the head he saw;
// and nothing is written before he confirms the diff of the messages.
//
// Nor may it launder the bot's text: the fields start as the bot's,
// Generated-by lines included, and nothing saves while any field still
// has one, so he has to go through each; he also states that the text
// is his. And `/promote --human-text` approves the new head, so the form
// offers it by default only when he already approved the head it
// replaces (same trees, so that approval carries over).
//
// TODO: code edits (a blob, tree and commit per edited file) are out of
// scope for now; larger ones belong in a local checkout anyway.
