// Review and chore asks: the tracker issues, besides questions, through
// which the bot asks jmarrero to do something. Pure functions over issue
// bodies and REST JSON, so tests feed them synthetic payloads.
//
// Every ask is an open issue in the tracker, assigned to him, with one
// of the labels `question`, `review` or `chore`, and a first line naming
// what it blocks (see answer.ts). After that, one ask per line:
//
//     Ask: Re-approve bootc#2500 at its new head
//     Review: `https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc/pull/2500` at <40-hex sha>
//
//     Ask: Rerun the composefs UKI legs that lost their runner
//     Rerun: `https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc/actions/runs/123456`
//
// A review names each PR to review and the head the bot expects; a chore
// may name workflow runs whose failed jobs to rerun. He finishes either
// with a comment on the issue, which the app posts for him after it
// reviews or reruns. A `Review:` or `Rerun:` line that doesn't parse
// exactly unlocks nothing: the issue then offers only a comment box.
