// The question and answer formats: what the bot writes, what the app
// writes as jmarrero, and what the bot parses back. Forge-neutral, and
// free of DOM and network code so that the bot-side parser can mirror it
// line for line.
//
// A question is an issue the bot opens in the tracker repository,
// labelled `question`. Its body:
//
//     Blocks: https://github.com/jmarrero-forge/tracker/issues/12
//     Context, any number of lines.
//     Q: Which prefix?
//     Options:
//     A) org.example
//     B) io.example
//     Recommended: A, because it is already registered
//
// The first line always names the board item it blocks, by its URL: bare
// for a tracker issue, in a code span for an upstream one, so that the
// mention doesn't show on the upstream timeline:
//
//     Blocks: `https://github.com/example/widget/pull/42`
//
// `Q:`, `Options:` and `Recommended:` count only outside fenced code
// blocks, and `Options:` and `Recommended:` only after the `Q:` line. Each
// option is exactly one line, `A) text`, lettered from A without gaps,
// at least two; an option wrapped onto a second line, or a lone option,
// makes the list unreadable, and the app says so rather than guess.
// Options and the recommendation may be absent (an action, or an open
// question); when there is a recommendation, it is option A.
//
// He answers with a plain comment on that issue: GitHub records who wrote
// it, so nothing else vouches for it. A picked option is the comment's
// first line, exactly the letter, optionally followed by his own text:
//
//     B
//     Free markdown from him, any number of lines.
//
// Without a pick, the comment is only his text.
